For the final results, please look at the numCrimalRelation.txt file. Overall ,we can conclude that density and city are a signficant factor for crime,
even moreso than price. In selecting a house that would be deemed safe, we consider a neighborhood as lower in density as safer, with a larger price yielding
safer results. Overall, the R2 score is about 60%, so there is an obvious relationship between price and the number of criminals nearby controlled for factors 
such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, density and city.
